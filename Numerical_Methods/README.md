# Laboratory Exercises Overview

This repository contains MATLAB implementations for laboratory exercises focusing on numerical methods and their applications in engineering. During the 3 semesters of my studies, I completed selected tasks, written in the Polish language, from the file Numerical_Methods.pdf, which was provided to me by the AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow. It seems to me that by working on these tasks, significant progress in problem-solving and programming has become evident over the course of several months.
